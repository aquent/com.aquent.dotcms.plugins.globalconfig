Global Configuration Plugin
====================
This plugin allows you to set global config varaiables.

Included is a Portlet to manage the config parameters and viewtool to get the values from the config.  The values are stored in your assets directory under aquentglobalconfig.json and are read read into a cache as they are used.  Many of the ideas for this plugin came from the plugin: [dotCMS Configuration](http://geekyplugins.com/dot-cms/configuration.dot) by [ISAAC - 100% Handcrafted Internet Solutions](https://www.isaac.nl/).
